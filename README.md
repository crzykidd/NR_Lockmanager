# NR_Lockmanager
NR_Lockmanager is a zwave lock manager that utilizes zwavejs2mqtt, node red, and Home Assistant.   

It allows you to manage multiple locks and has the following features:

* supports 1 or more locks
* allows you to turn access on or off to each lock by user
* allows for a single pin change to push to all locks.
 
I am actively working on this project and should be able to write up instructions and share code in the next couple weeks.
